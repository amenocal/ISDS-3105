                    <h1>History</h1>

                    <p>The history of Honduras is comprised of the history of its people. The country was inhabited by indigenous tribes of great linguistic and cultural diversity. The most powerful and advanced of these were the Mayans, who also populated Yucatán, Belize, and the northeast of Guatemala, and built their sacred city and ceremonial metropolis in Copán, in the western part of the country.</p>

                    <p>Descendants of these peoples and of the Mayas were the aborigines, who would later oppose the Spanish conquest and produce the legendary figures of Tecún Uman, Lempira, Atlacatl, Diriagúacutan, Nicarao and Urraca, leaders for autonomy among the native populations of Central America.</p>

                    <h3>Christopher Columbus Discovers Honduras</h3>
                    <p>On July 30, 1502, during his fourth and last trip through the Americas, Christopher Columbus reached the Bay Islands and soon afterwards the coast of the mainland. This was the first time he saw Honduran soil. From the Island of Guanaja, which he is said to have named, Columbus set sail toward the northern continental coast and in Punta Caxinas, now Puerto Castilla, he ordered the celebration of the first mass on the Honduran main land. In the Rio Tinto (Tinto River), which he named Rio de la Posesion, he claimed the territory in the name of his sovereigns, Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile.</p>

                    <h1>Places to Visit</h1>
                    <h3>Bay Islands - Roatan</h3>
                    <p>The island of Roatan is located 30 miles off the north coast of Honduras atop the worlds second largest coral reef. The reef attracts many fish, and is world known for scuba diving. It is approximately 77 kilometres (48 mi) long, and less than 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) across at its widest point. Roatan is the largest of the Bay Islands at about 77 kilometres (48 mi) long, and less than 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) at its widest. The island has a number of beaches, all of which are public. Originally an English colony, and later ceded to Honduras, Roatan has a mixture of english and spanish speaking natives. With two cruise ship ports, Roatan has become a cruise destination, and roads and beaches can be busy when ships are in port. Prices for services may be higher when a ship is in. In recent years the island has experienced a lot of development and has a number of resorts along with more rustic accommodation as well. The western side of the island is the most populated and where most tourists stay, and the eastern side is more remote and isolated. Roatan has a warm climate with daytime temperatures between 80-90 year round</p>

                    <h3>Mayan Ruins - Copan</h3>
                    <p>Copán was once one of the most beautiful and important cities of the Maya - one of the great ancient cultures of the American continent. Over the course of 400 years, the Maya people of Copán shaped a small valley in western Honduras into a great city, building pyramids, temples, plazas, sculpting intricate statues of kings, gods, and animals, and decorating it all in beautifully colored stucco. The ceremonial center at the heart of the city housed some of the best examples of Maya arquitecture and art to be found anywere, some of them reflecting the Maya people's skill at mathematics and astronomy.</p>
                    <p>Every city in the Maya world is know for being "specialized" at something. For example Tikal, in Guatemala, is known for the sheer height of its pyramids. In southern México, Palenque is known for the lavishly decorated tomb of one of its kings, Pacal. But Copán is famous for the both the quantity and quality of the carved stone sculptures that decorated plazas and temples in its ceremonial center - it is known by archeologists as the most "artistic" of all Maya cities.</p>
                    <p>Today, the ruins of Copán is one of the richest archeological sites to be found in the entire American continent and an increasingly popular tourist attraction. After 150 years of archeological research, Copán is perhaps the most researched and well documented Maya site of all. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site</p>

                <h3>Pulhapanzak Waterfalls - Yoro</h3>
                <p>Pulhapanzak is a Mayan name which means “white river overflow”.</p>
                <p>Pulhapanzak falls are located near Lake Yojoa in the province of Cortes. It is Honduras’ largest waterfall. Measuring nearly 140 feet, it appears to come out of nowhere, emerging from the tropical forests on the periphery with a raging torrent. The sound is nearly deafening especially when up close. Visitors have the option to explore the waterfall from above, or below, and in the past, some people have even taken the chance of dangling their feet over the edge. When traveling through Honduras this is one sight you will not want to miss.</p>
