<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%;"><span style="line-height:150%; font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">In Louisiana, driving  under the influence of <strong>alcohol</strong> remains a top safety issue. Drunk drivers are at  least 13 times more likely to cause a fatal crash than sober drivers, according  to a new <a href="http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/LevittPorterHowDangerousAre2001.pdf">study</a> by <a href="http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/home.html">Steven Levitt</a>, Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago and <a href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jrporter/">Jack Porter</a>,  Professor of Economics at Harvard University. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">The analysis of fatal  <strong>alcohol</strong>-related crashes in this section is based on an estimate obtained via a  classification model developed at LSU. The model was tested for past years and  shows very reliable results with a standard error less than 1%.&nbsp;&nbsp;The  reported <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content">BAC</a> results may be either based on a breathalyzer test or on a blood-<strong>alcohol</strong>  test. The crash report does not distinguish between the two types of tests.  However, in many cases, the&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content">BAC</a> test results are  still pending. For this reason, the classification model is applied to generate  missing&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content">BAC</a> results to estimate the percent of  <strong>alcohol</strong>-involved fatalities. &nbsp; <strong>Alcohol</strong>-related crashes occurred more  frequently on weekends than during the week. &nbsp;The evening hours and early morning hours on  weekends had the highest frequency of <strong>alcohol</strong>-involved crashes. Friday night  and Saturday night involved the highest frequency of <strong>alcohol</strong>-related fatal and  injury crashes. While Table A4 depicts the trend in the <strong>alcohol</strong>-related fatal,  injury and PDO crashes, the main findings may be summarized as follows:</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">455 traffic fatalities were estimated  to be <strong>alcohol</strong> related in 2006. </span></li>
  <li><span class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">417 of the 455 fatalities in  <strong>alcohol</strong>-involved crashes (91.6%) had either <strong>alcohol</strong> themselves or were driving  with a person who had <strong>alcohol</strong>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">63 of the fatalities in  <strong>alcohol</strong>-involved crashes (14.6%) where killed by another driver who used  <strong>alcohol</strong>. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "><strong>alcohol</strong> was involved more in urban area  crashes than in rural-area crashes (47% versus 46%).</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Of  particular concern is the involvement of drivers under the age of 21. Until  1995, the law did not address the illegal sale of <strong>alcohol</strong> to persons under age  21, but only the illegal purchase and possession of <strong>alcohol</strong> by persons under 21  years of age.&nbsp; In 1995, modifications of the law made it illegal to sell  <strong>alcohol</strong> to persons under the age of 21. This 1995 modification also made it  illegal to purchase and possess <strong>alcohol</strong> for persons&nbsp;less than 21 years of  age. Although challenged, courts upheld the law. In 1997, legislation passed  making it illegal for persons below 21 years of age to drive with a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content">BAC</a> of  0.02 or above (zero tolerance law). In 2004, a challenge of this 1997  legislation claimed that it capriciously discriminates against the youth  (18-20-year-olds). The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled in May 2004 that the zero  tolerance law is constitutional, thus upholding the 0.02 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content">BAC</a> law.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:150%;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">There are several ways of presenting  <strong>alcohol</strong>-related crashes by age: </span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">The first method is to compare crash rates (crashes per 100,000  licensed drivers) in an age group. Even though it is illegal for youths under  21 to consume <strong>alcohol</strong>, the <strong>alcohol</strong>-related crash rate for 18 to 20-year-old  drivers was about twice the average (30 versus 14 per 100,000 drivers) of  drivers of all groups in 2006. The same is true for drivers killed in  <strong>alcohol</strong>-related crashes (18 versus 11 per 100,000 drivers). </span></li>
  <li><span class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">A second method of understanding how <strong>alcohol</strong>-related crashes are  affected by age is comparing what percentage of the total of <strong>alcohol</strong>-related  involvement each age group has. While only 5.2% of the licensed drivers in 2006  were between 18 and 20 years old, 11% of the drivers in fatal crashes using  <strong>alcohol</strong> were of age 18-20 and 9% of the drivers killed using <strong>alcohol</strong>  were of ages 18-20. </span></li>
  <li><span class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">A third method is the&nbsp;percentage of <strong>alcohol</strong> use of drivers  in each age group. This percentage is based on the number of crashes each age  group is involved in. For instance, 33% of drivers in the age group 18-20 who  were in fatal crashes used <strong>alcohol</strong>.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table A6 shows that the percentage  of drivers arrested for DWI and not convicted continues to increase and stands  now at 66%; i.e. two out of three arrested drivers are not convicted of DWI.  The percentage of DWI 1<sup>st</sup>-4<sup>th</sup> was only 20% in 2006. The  remaining 14% took advantage of 984. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Table  A7 show the trend of crash rates (per 100,000 licensed drivers) of  <strong>alcohol</strong>-related crashes involving drivers ages 15-24. The table shows that the  <strong>alcohol</strong>-related crash rates for ages 15-17 declined in 2006. The fatal crash  rate was 20 per 100,000 licensed drivers and the injury crash rate was 177.  However, the <strong>alcohol</strong>-related fatal crash rate for 18-20 year-old and 21-24  year-old drivers was up in 2006. </span></p>
