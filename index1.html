    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a 23 years old. My major is in Computer Science with a minor in Information Management. I was born and raised in Honduras. I moved out of Honduras when I was 17 years old to go study abroad to Nicaragua. I studied Pre-Engineering. Then in 2011 I moved to Baton Rouge in order to finish my college career. This is my last semester at LSU, and will be graduating in December 2014.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies is soccer I like to watch it and play it. I like to watch different kinds of sports. Love video games(specially FIFA). I also love to hang out with my friends, to meet new people. I like to travel, and meet different cities and countries.</p>
    <p>I am taking this course because Web Development is something that I always been interested in. I think it is very fun do create website and to make them look however you like. Also, in order to create a website I think is very important to find a way in order to put it in the most popular pages ;)</p>
    <h2>My plans when I graduate</h2>
    <p>The plans when I graduate is to get a job in the IT area. Information Technology is something I have always been passionate about and that is the reason why I decided to go for Computer Science in college. </p>
    <p>While in my job, I would like to enjoy my work, and when on vacations would like to travel as much as I can. After that have my own family, put my own business and then retire in a house right next to the beach(preferably the Carribean).</p>
